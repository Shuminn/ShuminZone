<p>A junior schoolmate asked me a question about the <strong>difference of brain activity of human between seeing black-and-white film and color film</strong>. So today I searched for the information about color processing. I had thought that this was a question already solved. But I was amazed to find that it still havenâ€™t been explored clearly.</p>
